Taking the dogs for a walk on a sunny autumn day gives you time to think. Today it helped me realize how many cool (new!) things have happened in my life in the past year since we left Berlin and moved back to Finland.

In the last year, I have:

* bought my very first apartment
* formed a band with my awesome colleagues and performed to a real audience, three times thus far

- started to learn the guitar
- got my voice and my music heard on a real radio channel, and made an appearance in a couple of developer videos
- helped organize the first Finnish frontend web conference, as well as a local web community meetup
- visited my first international web developer conference in Italy, and met a bunch of awesome people
- bought a gym membership, and got a new hobby out of it 
- read more books than ever before (an excuse good enough to get the new Kindle as soon as it ships worldwide, right?)

The list of things I meant to do but yet haven’t done would be at least as long, but it really struck me when I grasped how good things had started to happen when you just took the first steps towards them. Many of these things boils down to boldly stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying new things and going new places, because that’s where magic starts to happen.
