Has it really been five months since I last blogged?

At any rate, I realized I’ll turn 30 next Friday and this is my chance to still deliberately write something as a twentysomething. I got thrown a surprise party yesterday – something I thought only happens in movies, and to people other than me. How awesome that was! I’m normally quite shy, but just being around people you like feels so good in retrospective I should do it more often. Maybe something to work for the next ten years. I’ll be sure to let you know how it worked out before I turn 40.
