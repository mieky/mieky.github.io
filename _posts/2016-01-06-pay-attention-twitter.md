> "I don't get Twitter, it's just people telling what they had for lunch"

If you remember once mentioned that to someone, I won't hold it against you! Twitter is a platform quite unlike any other, and that is both its strength and challenge. It has come a long way since its inception in 2006 (<a href="/images/twitter-homepage-2006.png" alt="Twitter back in 2006" title="you'll never be bored again... right.">image</a>), but lately its journey has been turbulent, to say the least.

### Ads

Seriously, nobody wants to see ads
    - Like this
    - And like this

I think Twitter should *allow people to pay*. I find a contradiction in them trying to get people to advertise in Twitter, but at the same time completely ignore the fact that there's a steady mass of Twitter power users, myself included, who would happily pay a small premium membership fee for a service they use all the time.

What would paying get one?

Paid features:
- no ads
- ability to buffer or schedule tweets right from the client
- ability to use with 3rd party clients (win-win! no more crippled interface for Tweetbot)
- ability to mute and filter tags and topics (no more 4sq, look at me I drink beer, salitwiitit)

Other improvements
- better use of 140 characters: cut more slack to allow links and usernames into the total character count
- threaded replies to allow better following a conversation? Jaiku did this (and allowed longer messages) and was very popular
- do meaningful previews for all popular media types. There was a time Instagram images were previewed in the official clients, but then Facebook happened, and Twitter users lost.

API considerations
- have you ever checked the ludicrous size of a single tweet in an API response? you could save big amounts of bandwidth by making the default data set smaller
- open up a free-to-access API for extracting tweet data. being too protective will only drive to other services

New ground

Twitter's search (search.twitter.com) is unbelievable. From the ludicrous amounts of data that Twitter stores each second, you only need to remember one keyword and you can find year-old tweets in an instant: https://twitter.com/search?q=mieky%20imagemagick&src=typd

Help users discover content to their liking. Who are my friends following whom I retweet all the time? What are the keywords that are most likely to trigger likes from me? I'm sure you know this stuff, or are able to figure it out.
