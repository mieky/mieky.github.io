<h1 class="mb-10" title="Moro is how we say hi in Tampere!">Moro!</h1>

I'm <strong>Mike Arvela</strong>, a web developer and family guy from [Tampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere), a mighty fine town in Northern Europe.

I enjoy working with people and technology. I get kicks from both creating stellar software, as well as helping people discover new ideas. I'm currently working as an independent web developer, helping select clients create something awesome.

You can find me on Twitter as [@mieky](https://twitter.com/mieky). For the curious, there's a bit of personal <a href="/about.html">history</a>.
