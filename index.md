<h1>Hi, pleased to meet you!</h1>

I'm <strong>Mike Arvela</strong>, a web developer and family guy. I live in [Tampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere), a mighty fine town in Northern Europe.

I enjoy working with people and technology. I get kicks from both creating stellar software, as well as helping people discover new ideas.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mieky), [GitHub](https://github.com/mieky), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arvela) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1011336-mike-arvela).
