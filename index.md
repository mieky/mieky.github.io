<h1 class="site-title">Hi there!</h1>

<p class="intro-line">My name is Mike Arvela.</p>

I'm a geek and a family guy from Tampere, one of the finest towns in Northern Europe. I work with software at [HERE Technologies](https://www.here.com). Before that I was with [Futurice](https://www.futurice.com/) for close to ten years.

I'm thrilled to work in the intersection of technology and people. I enjoy creating stellar software as well as helping people discover new ideas.

You can find me on Twitter as [@mieky](https://twitter.com/mieky). For the curious, there's a bit of personal <a href="/about.html">history</a>.
