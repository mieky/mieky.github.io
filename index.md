Hi! I'm Mike, a geek and dad from Tampere, Finland.

I work at [Futurice](http://www.futurice.com/), creating superb web applications, as well as helping my colleagues become better at what they do. I also co-founded [Alupark](http://www.alupark.fi/), where we offer web technology consultancy.

You can find me on Twitter as [@mieky](https://twitter.com/mieky). For the curious, there's a bit of personal <a href="/about.html">history</a>.
