I'm Mike, a geek and dad from Tampere, Finland.

I craft web software at [Futurice](http://www.futurice.com/). We also founded this little company called [Alupark](http://www.alupark.fi/) to craft superb mobile apps, such as [Thingot](http://thingot.alupark.fi).

You can find me in Twitter as [@mieky](https://twitter.com/mieky).
