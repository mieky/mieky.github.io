<h1 class="mb-10">Hi there!</h1>

I'm <strong>Mike Arvela</strong>, a web developer and family guy from Tampere â€“ a mighty fine town in Northern Europe. I work with location platforms at <a href="https://www.here.com/" class="external-link">HERE Technologies</a>. Before that I spent an awesome ten years at a consultancy called [Futurice](https://www.futurice.com/).

I enjoy working with people and technology. I get kicks from both creating stellar software, as well as helping people discover new ideas.

You can find me on Twitter as [@mieky](https://twitter.com/mieky). For the curious, there's a bit of personal <a href="/about.html">history</a>.
