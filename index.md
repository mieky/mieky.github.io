<h1>Hi, nice to meet you!</h1>

I'm <strong>Mike Arvela</strong>, a web developer and family guy. I live in [Tampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampere), a mighty fine town in Northern Europe.

I enjoy working with people and technology. I'm thrilled by smooth web experiences and am a fan of life-long learning.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mieky), [GitHub](https://github.com/mieky), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arvela) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1011336-mike-arvela).
